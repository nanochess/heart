Heart drawing using heart curve equation
by Oscar Toledo G. Feb/14/2021

A small demo program drawing a heart using this equation:

    x=16*pow(sin(t),3);
    y=13*cos(t)-5*cos(2*t)-2*cos(3*t)-cos(4*t);

If you want to assemble it, you must download the Netwide Assembler
(nasm) from www.nasm.us

Use this command line:

  nasm -f bin heart.asm -Dcom_file=1 -o heart.com
  nasm -f bin heart.asm -Dcom_file=0 -o heart.img

Tested with VirtualBox for Mac OS X running Windows XP running this
game, it also works with DosBox and probably with qemu:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -fda heart.img

Enjoy it!
